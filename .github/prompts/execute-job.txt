Branch Handling:
- Use exactly this branch name: {{CANONICAL_BRANCH}}
- If branch already exists: checkout and continue from it
- If branch does not exist: create from {{DEFAULT_BRANCH}}
- Push your commits to the branch

⚠️ CRITICAL: DO NOT OPEN A PULL REQUEST
Pull request creation is handled by the workflow AFTER you exit.
Your job ends when you push commits to the branch.

⚠️ CRITICAL RETRY RULE:
On retries, you MUST:
1. Check feedback history in your prompt context
2. Address ALL feedback issues
3. Push at least one commit with your changes

Even if you believe the existing code is correct, push a commit (fix formatting, add comments, improve types) to advance the pipeline.

After completing work, output the branch name clearly so it can be verified.
