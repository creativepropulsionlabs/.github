Branch/PR Handling:

- If branch already exists: checkout and continue from it
- If PR already exists: update it with new commits
- If neither exists: create branch from {{DEFAULT_BRANCH}} and open PR

⚠️ CRITICAL RETRY RULE:
An existing PR does NOT mean the job is complete. You MUST:
1. Check feedback history in your prompt context
2. Address ALL feedback issues
3. Push at least one commit with your changes
4. Output the PR URL

Even if you believe the existing code is correct, push a commit (fix formatting, add comments, improve types) to advance the pipeline.

After completing work, output the PR URL clearly so it can be extracted.
